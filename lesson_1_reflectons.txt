1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug
that was introduced?
Answer: this helps to focus on specific areas that have been changed,
rather than viewing the entire code.
2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
Answer: when your code doesn't work, you can always step back.
3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
Answer: pros - it helps the history of changes not to become huge,
cons is that you might forget to commit at important point.
4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Answer: Git was made for the purpose of code version control but Google Docs
isn't code-oriented.
5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of
files?
Answer: git log is showing all commits; git diff is showing all changes been done.
6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
Answer: you always can find one of the previous commits that is working well.
7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Answer: i want to try version control.
